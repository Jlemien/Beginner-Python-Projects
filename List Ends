#having the user enter some numbers. This is an exercise from http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/25/12-list-ends.html
a = input("Tell me a number ")
b = input("Tell me another number ")
c = input("Tell me another number ")
d = input("Tell me another number ")
e = input("Tell me another number ")

#putting the users inputs into a list
original_list=[str(a), str(b), str(c), str(d), str(e)]

#creating a new list which consists of the first and last entries of the original list
first_and_last_list = original_list[:1] + original_list[-1:]

#printing it out so the user can see the results.
print("Your original list was " + str(original_list))
print("Your new list is " + str(first_and_last_list))
